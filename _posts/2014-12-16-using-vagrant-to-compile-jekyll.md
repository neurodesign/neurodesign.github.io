I like to keep my projects stacks inside their own virtual machine. When i started looking at jekyll as a blogging platform, in particular because it's available for free on github pages, i decided to do just that.

The vagrant files I found required the files to be edited inside the vm, not on the host machine, so i created my own.

The vagrant project is available on github: [vagrant jekyll](https://github.com/neurodesign/vagrant-jekyll).

Clone that project, vagrant up, edit your files and see the result updated on each modification at localhost:4000.

    class EssaiDeCode {
        public function test() {
            echo "hello world";
            for ($coincoincoincoincoincoin = 0 ; $coincoincoincoincoincoin < 100 ; $coincoincoincoincoincoin++) {
                echo "coin";
            }
        }
    }
